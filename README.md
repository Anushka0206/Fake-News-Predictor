#Fake News Detection using NLP in Jupyter Notebook
This project aims to detect fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The model is trained to classify news as FAKE or REAL based on the article content.

## Environment
Jupyter Notebook (Recommended)

## Technologies Used
Pandas – data handling

NumPy – numerical operations

Matplotlib / Seaborn – data visualization

NLTK – text preprocessing

Scikit-learn – machine learning tools

## Dataset
The dataset used is Fake.csv, which contains:

title – Headline of the news article

text – Full content of the article

subject – Category or topic (e.g., News, Politics)

date – Date of publication

(Assumption: Dataset includes a label column with FAKE or REAL values)

## How to Use (Jupyter Notebook)
Open your terminal or Anaconda Prompt and launch Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Open the notebook file:
fake_news_detection.ipynb

Run each cell step-by-step:

Import libraries

Load dataset

Preprocess text

Vectorize text using TF-IDF

Train model

Evaluate results

##Output
Accuracy Score of the model

Classification Report with precision, recall, F1-score

Confusion Matrix Heatmap for visual evaluation

## Steps Followed in Notebook
Importing Libraries

Loading the Dataset

Text Cleaning – Lowercasing, removing punctuation and stopwords

TF-IDF Vectorization

Model Training – Logistic Regression

Evaluation – Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Report

##Future Scope
Experiment with other models (SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest)

Add LSTM or Transformer-based Deep Learning models

Build a web interface using Flask or Streamlit for live news testing
